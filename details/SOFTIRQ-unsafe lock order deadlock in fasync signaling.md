# 🐛 SOFTIRQ-unsafe lock order deadlock in fasync signaling

## 📌 Overview

* **Location:** `fs/fcntl.c`
* **Current Status:** [CVE-2026-52946](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2026-52946) ✅ **Patch Accepted** **(vfs-7.2.misc branch)**  **Applied to all stable trees(v5.10-v7.1)**
* **Notes:** A SOFTIRQ-safe to SOFTIRQ-unsafe lock order deadlock in `send_sigio()` and `send_sigurg()`. When FASYNC is configured for a process group, taking `read_lock(&tasklist_lock)` in softirq context (e.g., during TCP URG packet reception) can deadlock against process-context writers due to rwlock fairness. Fixed by replacing the `tasklist_lock` with `rcu_read_lock()`, which also mitigates a potential remote DoS vector.
